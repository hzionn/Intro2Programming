- [[Practice]] Concatenate Strings and Variables
	- You need to:
		- concatenate strings and variables
		- 1729 Pennies in Dollars and Cents
	- ```python
	  pennies = 1729
	  
	  print(f"given {pennies} pennies, convert it into dollars and cents.")
	  
	  # // symbol will return only the integer part
	  dollars = pennies // 100
	  # % symbol will return only the remainder
	  cents = pennies % 100
	  
	  # so that we can have it in dollars and cents
	  print(f"dollars: {dollars}")
	  print(f"cents: {cents}")
	  ```
	- `=` means assign, we assign a [[integer]]/`int` value to `pennies` variable
	- we use `f""` (f-string) to plug variable into a `str`
	- `//` and `%` are both Python [[operators]] .
-
- [[Practice]] Problem Solving
	- You need to:
		- solve the problem by implement a specific [[algorithm]]
		- construct algorithm with given constraints
	- ```python
	  # declare constants
	  TOTAL_WIDTH = 100
	  TILE_WIDTH = 5
	  
	  # first and last one have to be black tile
	  # then place black and white interchangeably
	  n_pairs = int((TOTAL_WIDTH - TILE_WIDTH) / (2 * TILE_WIDTH))
	  print(f"number of pairs: {n_pairs}")
	  
	  n_tiles = 1 + (2 * n_pairs)
	  print(f"number of tiles: {n_tiles}")
	  
	  total_gap = TOTAL_WIDTH - n_tiles * TILE_WIDTH
	  print(f"total gap: {total_gap}")
	  
	  each_gap = total_gap / 2
	  print(f"each gap: {each_gap}")
	  ```
	- `int()` is a Python built-in function, which can turn number into [[int]]
-
- [[Practice]] input
	- You need to:
		- write a poem that similar to 《像極了愛情》
		- let user input sentence every time they run the code
	- ```python
	  message = "請你給我一句優美的句子："
	  user_input_1 = input(message)
	  user_input_2 = input(message)
	  user_input_3 = input(message)
	  user_input_4 = input(message)
	  user_input_5 = input(message)
	  
	  print("=" * 50)  # print 50 =
	  print(user_input_1)
	  print(user_input_2)
	  print(user_input_3)
	  print(user_input_4)
	  print(user_input_5)
	  
	  print("像極了愛情")
	  ```
	- `input()` is also a Python build-in function, which let user input text
	- note that not only number can use [[operators]]
	- ```python
	  user_input = [input("請你給我一句優美的句子：") for _ in range(5)]
	  
	  print("=" * 50)
	  # print input by loop through the list
	  for sentence in user_input:
	      print(sentence)
	  print("像極了愛情")
	  ```
	- to put something into a [[list]] with [[loop]], we can use [[list comprehension]]
	- if we can compact multiple lines of code into one line, we called it one liner
