- [[Practice]] Hello World
	- You need to:
		- just print Hello World in python
	- ```python
	  print("Hello World")
	  ```
	- `print()` is a Python built-in function
	- `"Hello World"` is a argument/parameter that we pass to `print()`
	- everything that wrap inside `""` is called a `string` or `str` for short
