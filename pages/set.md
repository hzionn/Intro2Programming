- `set` is like a bag, things which in the bag are not ordered.
- note that we **cant** create an empty set
- an empty `{}` will only create a dictionary
- ```python
  # this will create a empty dictionary
  numbers = {}
  print(type(numbers))
  print(numbers)
  
  # while this will create a set
  numbers = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5}
  print(type(numbers))
  print(numbers)
  ```
